# My Rides

Shows a list of all of your rides with detail screen.

### Dependencies

* iOS 17.2+
* Third-party libraries: SnapKit

### Improvements

* Better error handling for currecy conversion
* Create builders for attributted strings
* Localization
* Documentaion
* Unit testing
* Better Http error handling
* Currency comes from backend as an Int not sure why this is not a Double. So without API documenaion I cannot assume 1736 is really 17.36
